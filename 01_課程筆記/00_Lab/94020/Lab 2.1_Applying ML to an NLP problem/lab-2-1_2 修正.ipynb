    "# Lab 2.1: Applying ML to an NLP Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the built-in machine learning (ML) model in Amazon SageMaker, __LinearLearner__, to predict the __isPositive__ field of the review dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the business scenario\n",
    "You work for an online retail store that wants to improve customer engagement for customers who have posted negative reviews. The company wants to detect negative reviews and assign these reviews to a customer service agent to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with solving part of this problem by using ML to detect negative reviews. You were given access to a dataset that contains reviews, which have been classified as positive or negative. You will use this dataset to train an ML model to predict the sentiment of new reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this dataset\n",
    "The [AMAZON-REVIEW-DATA-CLASSIFICATION.csv](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-nlp/tree/master/data/examples) file contains actual reviews of products, and these reviews include both text data and numeric data. Each review is labeled as _positive (1)_ or _negative (0)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following features:\n",
    "* __reviewText:__ Text of the review\n",
    "* __summary:__ Summary of the review\n",
    "* __verified:__ Whether the purchase was verified (True or False)\n",
    "* __time:__ UNIX timestamp for the review\n",
    "* __log_votes:__ Logarithm-adjusted votes log(1+votes)\n",
    "* __isPositive:__ Whether the review is positive or negative (1 or 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this lab is being provided to you by permission of Amazon and is subject to the terms of the Amazon License and Access (available at https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000).

It comes in a completely nondescript envelope so it's easy to miss. But it's a real, live AmEX prepaid gift card. I used it last night in fact. And today I remembered to go cancel my automatic renewal service. Contrary to what some others have said, it took on the first time and wasn't a big deal. I used a throw away email address when I signed up (though I haven't received any email from them since) so it took me longer to figure out what my username was to sign in than it did for me to actually cancel.   \n",

    "You will often perform many tasks on data before you use it to train a model. These steps must also be done on any data that's used for inference after the model is deployed. A good way of organizing these steps is to define a _pipeline_. A pipeline is a collection of processing tasks that will be performed on the data. Different pipelines can be created to process different fields. Because you are working with both text and numeric data, you can define the following pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For the numerical features pipeline, the __numerical_processor__ uses a MinMaxScaler. (You don't need to scale features when you use decision trees, but it's a good idea to see how to use more data transforms.) If you want to perform different types of processing on different numerical features, you should build different pipelines, like the ones that are shown for the two text features.\n",
    "   * For the text features pipeline, the __text_processor__ uses `CountVectorizer()` for the text fields.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The selective preparations of the dataset features are then put together into a collective ColumnTransformer, which will be used with in a pipeline along with an estimator. This process ensures that the transforms are performed automatically on the raw data when you fit the model or make predictions. (For example, when you evaluate the model on a validation dataset via cross-validation, or when you make predictions on a test dataset in the future.)"

You then deployed the model and performed some predictions. If you were doing this for real, you would likely need to obtain the data and label it for training. An alternative might be to use a pretrained algorithm or managed service. You would also likely tune the model further using a hyperparameter tuning job.\n",
